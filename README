This is the 1D repository for my summer research. 

Nesh if you want to correct or run my code it will all be up here. 
I assume that you know how to use this site, but if not, I can meet with you and talk to you about it.

Open simple1d3.py. The .dat files are the pictures that we took on 5/21.

I think if you correct the code online it should not be an issue but getting the whole thing setup on my computer was a little difficult.
